# mapping-tester
This is an application that utilizes both the current production API from NCBI (at https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/) as well as the test version (at https://eutilspreview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/) to illustrate how the "new" version of Automatic Term Mapping can change what a given search does.
